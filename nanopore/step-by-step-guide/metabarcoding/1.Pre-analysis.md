## Preparations
We perform quality control using FastQC on our lab's Linux server or UGent HPC. You have to login into your own account, if you don't have one ask Zixia to creat one for you.

Install bioconda if it is not already installed on your system. It is specifically designed for the easy installation and management of bioinformatics softwares. You can follow the instructions at https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html to install it.

Once bioconda is installed, open a terminal and activate the bioconda environment by running the command:

```
conda activate bioconda
```

## 1. Quality Control

### Using FastQC to do quality control based on .fast5 files

Install FastQC using the following command:

```
conda install -c bioconda fastqc
# Click y if it ask proceed or not.
```

Put the `.fast5` files that you want to analyze in a single directory. Run FastQC on the .fast5 files using the following command, replace all the `INPUT_FILE_PATH` with your directory and choose reasonable thread numbers.

```
mkdir -p "INPUT_FILE_PATH/raw_qc"
fastqc --outdir "INPUT_FILE_PATH/raw_qc/" --threads 24 INPUT_FILE_PATH/*.fast5
```

This command runs FastQC on all the .fast5 files in the directory and generates an HTML report for each file. But it's not a good idea to go through the reports one by one, here we generate a single report from the FastQC results using MultiQC:

```
conda install -c bioconda multiqc
```

Navigate to the directory where the FastQC reports are stored, in our case `INPUT_FILE_PATH/raw_qc/`, then run the MultiQC:

```
cd INPUT_FILE_PATH/raw_qc
multiqc .
```

This will generate a single report summarizing the quality control results from all the FastQC reports in the current directory. To view the MultiQC report, open the file called `multiqc_report.html` in a web browser.
