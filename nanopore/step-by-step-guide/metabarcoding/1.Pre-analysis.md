## Preparations
We perform quality control using FastQC on our lab's Linux server or UGent HPC. You have to login into your own account, if you don't have one ask Zixia to creat one for you.

Install bioconda if it is not already installed on your system. It is specifically designed for the easy installation and management of bioinformatics softwares. You can follow the instructions at https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html to install it.

Once bioconda is installed, open a terminal and activate the bioconda environment by running the command:

```
conda activate bioconda
```

## 1. Quality Control

Install FastQC using the following command:

```
conda install fastqc
```

Navigate to the directory containing the .fast5 files that you want to analyze. For example:

```
cd /data/20230130_1357_MN18414_FAM93703_1763f310
```

Run FastQC on the .fast5 files using the following command:

```
fastqc *.fast5
```

This command runs FastQC on all the .fast5 files in the current directory and generates an HTML report for each file.

View the FastQC reports by opening the HTML files in a web browser.
